Tiny PHP framework
===================

My personal collection of PHP classes for building small and intermediate websites. It features [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) for database access, [AltoRouter](http://altorouter.com) for processing requests and [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net) as a template engine.

Documentation is work in progress. Please, take a look at the source code for more information. 

How to install
------------------
Clone this repo or download all files and, after installing [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), run `composer install`. It should resolve all dependencies.
